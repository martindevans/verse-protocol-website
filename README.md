# verse-protocol-website
This is the code behind the [verse protocol website](http://verse-protocol.appspot.com/) which was made as a central point for gathering information on the verse protocol. This project and the website are long since abandoned, and this repository is only here for historical reasons (exported from google code, so this repo is really much older than it appears).
